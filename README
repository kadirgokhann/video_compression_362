I tried to write clean-modular and easily followable code.

All the operations start from compress.m and decompress.m.
The algorithm utilizes the functions under this directory, Utils.m, etc.

We have the ones below, which have two functions Process(), Invert().
    RLE.m
    ZigZagScan.m
    Quantization.m
    DCT.m

The part1.compression_ratio.m and part1_psnr.m uses the same functions
to perform the task.


For the constants, you can use Constants.m.


You can just run the videoCreation.m to see the video.
